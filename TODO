if a module function is assigned to an alias e.g

import math;
randf=math.randint;
var x=randf(1,10);

randf call does not do a module invoke,  just a call, so the module environment is not in scope and global lookups fail  ( e.g nested imports) 


can compile prevent shadowing of builtins by new vars/funcs?
