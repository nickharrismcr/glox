func foo(){
    b=1
    b=b+2
}
- assigns to global not local.  var b=1 works ok 

class methods - look into scoping
- can refer to classname inside class methods but probably also need class vars 
 
method return gives compile error unless has semicolon: 
  draw(win,cam) {
        if (this.foo()) {
            return  <----  
        }

replace NIL_VAL with constant core.NILVALUE 


can compile prevent shadowing of builtins by new vars/funcs?


fix nested function scope:
fun outer() {
    fun a() { b(); }
    fun b() { print "foo"; }
    a();
}

outer();

gives
Uncaught exception: <class RunTimeError> : "Undefined variable b"
File 'nod.lox' , line 2, in a 
    fun a() { b(); }
File 'nod.lox' , line 4, in outer
    a();
File 'nod.lox' , line 7, in <module>
outer();

as its trying to resolve b as a global.  the upvalue search in a goes to the outer function but 
doesn't find b in its locals
