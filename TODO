 

compiler complains about a++ inside a class method and for statements 
remove ++ operator altogether and add += -=


class methods - look into scoping
- can refer to classname inside class methods but probably also need class vars 
 
 

===========================================
fix nested function scope:
===========================================

fun outer() {
    fun a() { b(); }
    fun b() { print "foo"; }
    a();
}

outer();

gives
Uncaught exception: <class RunTimeError> : "Undefined variable b"
File 'nod.lox' , line 2, in a 
    fun a() { b(); }
File 'nod.lox' , line 4, in outer
    a();
File 'nod.lox' , line 7, in <module>
outer();

as its trying to resolve b as a global.  the upvalue search in a goes to the outer function but 
doesn't find b in its locals 
need two passes to resolve this:
    1. First pass: add functions to locals 
    2. Second pass:  compile the function body
