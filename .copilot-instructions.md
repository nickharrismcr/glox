# Copilot Instructions for GLox Project

## Terminal Usage
- **ALWAYS** use `./run.sh <script>` to run GLox scripts
- **NEVER** use PowerShell commands in bash terminal
- Read `TERMINAL_INSTRUCTIONS.md` before running any terminal commands
- Working directory is already set to `c:\Users\nicholas.harris\glox`

## Lox Language Rules
- **NEVER** use multiline statements in Lox code
- Each statement must be on a single line
- Break complex expressions into multiple variables if needed
- Function calls like `vec3()` must have all arguments on the same line

## Project Architecture
- Controller position: Grid coordinates
- Camera position: World coordinates
- Movement: Grid-based with smooth interpolation to world coordinates
- Decision making: Goal-oriented at intersections (look two steps ahead)

## Code Patterns
- Use `even()` function to ensure street-only navigation
- Grid movement in 2-unit steps (one street to next street)
- Boundary checking with 2-step lookahead
- Smooth rotation and movement interpolation

## Files to Remember
- `cube_stack_fly2.lox`: Main demo with grid-based movement
- `TERMINAL_INSTRUCTIONS.md`: Required reading for terminal commands
- `src/vm.go`: VM implementation with dictionary key and vector math fixes

## Debug Patterns
- Always include `[DEBUG]` prefix in debug output
- Log state transitions, grid positions, and decision points
- Test with `./run.sh lox_examples/cube_stack_fly2.lox`
